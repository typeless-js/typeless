# Roadmap

- **Custom Forms**  
Work in progress.
- **Routing module**  
Work in progress.
- **Standalone logging module**  
Work in progress. For now use [redux-logger](https://github.com/LogRocket/redux-logger).
- **Server-side rendering**  
It cannot be implemented at this moment. `React.Lazy` doesn't support SSR.
- **Testing example**  
Work in progress. Everything is testable, but need to create explicit examples.
